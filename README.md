# RemoveLineBreaks
[Popclip](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions) extension. Replace line break to space from the selected text, so the line break will be removed. This is useful for some PDF files in which line breaks are inserted at incorrect positions.



## Installation

1. Get popclip app from app store.
2. Download Zip file from Github.
3. Double click RemoveLineBreaks.popclipext. 



If it does not work, probably path to php is wrong. Open noLineBreaks.php and change the 1st line to your executable php path.
